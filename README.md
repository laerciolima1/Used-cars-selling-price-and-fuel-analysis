## Machine Learning Regression and Classification Models for Used Cars

This project aims to demonstrate the performance of different types of regression and classification models in predicting the prices and fuel types of used cars. 

### Background
Machine Learning (ML) is a scientific study of statistical models and algorithms that intends to enable computer systems to perform tasks that they were not originally programmed to do, while maintaining an acceptable level of accuracy. The main advantage of using ML models is that, once the algorithms learn the data patterns, they achieve a level of automation that can be seen during the performed tasks.

This project intends to use ML as a tool to better understand some characteristics of supervised machine learning models. By analyzing the used cars dataset, it is possible to transform the data into information, predict future events, and understand how different inputs and parameters can affect the output.

### Project Overview
The project consists of several steps, including:

* Exploratory data analysis
* Data cleaning
* Treatment of categorical and numerical features
* Performance comparison of different types of regression and classification models
* Prediction of prices and fuel types

### Results and Conclusion
During the research period, I had the opportunity to better understand concepts of exploratory data analysis and machine learning. By performing different types of models in the same dataset, I was able to experience real-life problems, such as finding different models to answer different questions.

### Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the instructors and colleagues who have contributed to the development of this project, as well as the creators of the used cars dataset.
